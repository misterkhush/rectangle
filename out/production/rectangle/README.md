# This project contains operations that are performed on Rectangle such as:
# Intersection, Containment, And Adjacent

# To test the operations you can run main class and follow instructions carefully
# Enter coordinates for lower left and upper right corner of both rectangles(on separate likes) in this format (lowerX,lowerY,upperX,upperY): for example like this
# 1,2,3,4
# 5,6,7,8
# And then choose operation = 1:Intersection, 2: Containment, 3:Adjacent

# Or you can directly run executable jar included in main directory by using following command
# java -jar rectangle.jar
